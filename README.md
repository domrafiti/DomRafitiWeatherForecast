For this assignment i created a weather dashboard that leverages bootstramp components and is dynamically updated based on information retrieved from an API call. 

once the user enters the city and hits search, the API call is made, the data is stored in memory and then presented to the user

I had attempted to build out a historical search option and ran out of time to implement fully - would love input on how to better make this happen

i tried putting a screenshot in this section and was unable to do so.
